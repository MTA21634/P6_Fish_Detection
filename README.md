## Description
Tracking of fish in an underwater footage from `Limfjord`. The system features object detection and tracking. The object detection consists of: `Running average` and `Gaussian Mixture Models` combination for background subtraction. The tracker consists of: histogram comparison using `Chebishev's Distance`, shape comparison using `Hu Moments`, and geometrical property comparison using `Euclidean Distance` and area of the blob.
